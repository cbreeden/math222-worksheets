{\bf Problem 1} \quad The natural logarithm satisfies the initial value problem $y'(x) = \dfrac{1}{x}$, where $y(1) = 0$.  Use Euler's method with a step-size of $h = \frac{1}{3}$ to approximate $\ln 2$.


\vfill

{\bf Problem 2} \quad We start with a full 10,000 gallon vat containing a solution of 3\% acid. There is a pipe brining in a solution of 5\% acid at a rate of 10 gallons per minute, and another pipe removing the mixed solution from the vat at a rate of 15 gallons per minute.  Write out a differential equation, with any necessary initial conditions, that describes the total amount of acid (in gallons) in the vat at any given time $t$ (in minutes). \textbf{You do not need to solve this differential equation}
